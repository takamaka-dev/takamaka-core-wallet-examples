# Takamaka Core Wallet Examples
This project aims to explain the use of the Takamaka Core Wallet library.

We're currently setting up an automated process to request testnet coins, TKG and TKR. In the meantime anyone who's interested may receive some by sending an email at info@takamaka.io and providing a valid takamaka address.

BCQTESLAPSSC1Round2 will be used instead of BCQTESLAPSSC1Round1 since the latter is still an experimental suite

The following transactions are allowed on the takamaka blockchain:
- [PAY](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitPay.java)
> A blockchain pay refers to the process of making a payment using a blockchain network. A payment on a blockchain network is essentially a digital transaction that transfers ownership of a digital asset such as cryptocurrency. In a blockchain pay, the sender initiates the transaction by providing their digital wallet address and the recipient's address, along with the amount of digital assets to be transferred. The transaction is then broadcast to the network, where it is verified and processed by the nodes in the network. Once the transaction is confirmed, the digital assets are transferred to the recipient's digital wallet, and the transaction is recorded on the blockchain register. Blockchain payments are typically faster and cheaper than traditional banking transfers and have the potential to make financial transactions more efficient and accessible. It's worth noting that Blockchain payments are not limited to cryptocurrency, It could be used for other use cases like making micropayments for digital content, for instance, and also in other industries like Supply Chain Management, where it can be used to track and trace the origin of goods.
- [STAKE](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitStake.java)
>A blockchain stake refers to the amount ofryptocurrency a person holds and is willing to pledge asollateral in order to participate in the consensus processof a specific blockchain network. The term is most commonlyused in the context of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchainsystems, where individuals can \"stake\" their coins tovalidate transactions and secure the network, rather thanusing computer power to solve complex mathematical puzzles(as in proof-of-work systems). The more coins a personstakes, the greater their chances of being selected tovalidate a block of transactions and earn a reward.
- [STAKE UNDO](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitStakeUndo.java)
>A blockchain stake undo refers to the process of removing astake from a blockchain network. This typically involves aperson who has previously \"staked\" their coins in aproof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain system choosing to\"unstake\" them and withdraw them from the network.The process of unstaking often involves a waiting period,during which the coins are locked and cannot be used ortransferred. This waiting period is in place to ensure thatthe network remains secure and to prevent potential attacks.Once the waiting period is over, the staked coins can bewithdrawn and used as normal.It's worth noting that unstaking process can be differentdepends on the specific blockchainnetwork and its protocols.
- [REGISTER MAIN](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitRegisterMain.java)
>This transaction is used to register a qTesla address as a \"main\" address and thus enable it to receive stakes and have nodes connected to it. Stakes also made on any “overflow” connected to a “main” are consolidated on it when calculating and dividing slots among nodes. The “main” address must be of type qTesla and present in the \"from\" field, the only mandatory field in this type of transaction. Register main transactions (both in mainnet and test network) can be compiled also with ED25519 but they will never be included. In order to properly include the transaction is mandatory to use BCQTESLAPSSC1Round2 InstanceWalletKeystoreInterface
- [REGISTER OVERFLOW](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitRegisterOverflow.java)
>Transaction used to register a qTesla address as an \"overflow\" address. Unlike the \"main\" address, which can represent a pool of nodes and have several overflows attached to it, the latter represent the physical servers that manage and allow the blockchain to function. Stakes also made on any overflows attached to a main are consolidated on it for calculation and division of slots among nodes. The “overflow” address must be of type qTesla and present in the \"from\" field, the only mandatory field in this type of transaction. Register overflow transactions (both in mainnet and test network) can be compiled also with ED25519 BUT they will never be included. In order to properly include the transaction is mandatory to use BCQTESLAPSSC1Round2 InstanceWalletKeystoreInterface
- [DEREGISTER MAIN](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitDeRegisterMain.java)
>Transaction used to deregister a \"main\" address so asto remove it from the mining-enabled address pool.Deregistering a \"main\" also automatically removes all assignments of any \"overflow\" addresses. These can be re-registered to a new “main” address. The address of \"main\"must be of type qTesla and present in the \"from\" field, the only mandatory field in this type of transaction. Deregister main transactions (both in mainnet and test network) can be compiled also with ED25519 but they will never be included. In order to properly include the transaction is mandatory to use BCQTESLAPSSC1Round2 InstanceWalletKeystoreInterface
- [DEREGISTER OVERFLOW](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitDeRegisterOverflow.java)
>Transaction used to deregister an \"overflow\" address so as to remove it from the pool of nodes assigned to a \"main\" address. Deregistering an \"overflow\" also automatically removes the connection to the \"main\" address it may have been assigned to. The \"overflow\" address must be of type qTesla and present in the \"from\" field, the only mandatory field in this type of transaction. Deregister overflow transactions (both in mainnet and test network) can be compiled also with ED25519 but they will never be included. In order to properly include the transaction is mandatory to use BCQTESLAPSSC1Round2 InstanceWalletKeystoreInterface
- [ASSIGN OVERFLOW](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitAssignOverflow.java)
>Transaction used to assign an \"overflow\" address to a \"main\". For this transaction to be successful both addresses must already be registered as such via their respective transactions, \"REGISTER_OVERFLOW\" and \"REGISTER_MAIN\". The address of \"main\" must be in the \"from\" field and the address of \"overflow\" in the \"to\" field of the transaction, which are also mandatory. Only the address of \"main\" can assign itself an \"overflow\". A \"main\" address can have multiple \"overflow\" addresses assigned, but an \"overflow\" address can be assigned to only one \"main\" address. Assign overflow transactions (both in mainnet and test network) can be compiled also with ED25519 but they will never be included. In order to properly include the transaction is mandatory to use BCQTESLAPSSC1Round2 InstanceWalletKeystoreInterface
- [UNASSIG OVERFLOW](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitUnassignOverflow.java)
>Transaction used to remove the assignment between a \"main\" and an \"overflow\" address. The addresses remain registered with their respective qualifications and can be reassigned. Unlike the assignment transaction, \"ASSIGN_OVERFLOW,\" which must be done by the \"main\" address, this can be done by either the \"main\" or the \"overflow”. Unassign overflow transactions (both in mainnet and test network) can be compiled also with ED25519 but they will never be included. In order to properly include the transaction is mandatory to use BCQTESLAPSSC1Round2 InstanceWalletKeystoreInterface
- [BLOB](src/main/java/io/takamaka/takamaka/core/wallet/examples/SubmitBlob.java)(image, text, rich text, hash)
>A "blob" transaction in a blockchain is a type of transaction that stores binary data, such as a document or image, on the blockchain. This data is typically stored as a "hash," which is a unique digital fingerprint of the data that can be used to verify its authenticity. Blob transactions are often used to store important documents, such as contracts, on a blockchain for secure and tamper-proof storage.
